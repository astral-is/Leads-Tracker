# Leads Tracker
## This is a Leads Tracker web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
### This project allows users to :
* Save important URLs or leads directly from their browser or through manual input. 
* The application stores the data in local storage, so the saved leads persist across sessions. 
* Users can also delete all saved leads with a double-click function.

The project demonstrates my understanding of DOM manipulation, local storage management, and event handling in JavaScript.
